# Todo Frontend

This is a simple Todo app built with React and redux and also integrated with the Backend api.

## Tech Stack

This project is built with:

- Javascript -> Language
- React -> View Framework
- Redux -> Main Framework

## Requirements

If you user docker, you won't need to install anything. But To run it standalone you'll need to download the following:

- [NodeJs 6+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Running

We recommend using the script `run.sh` to make it simple(better explained [here](../README.md) ) but if you want to run it standalone you'll need to have the Api(backend) running first. After having the backend running just run the following on the `client` path:

- `$ npm install && npm start`
